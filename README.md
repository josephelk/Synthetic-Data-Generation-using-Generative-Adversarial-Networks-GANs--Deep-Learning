# Synthetic-Data-Generation-using-Generative-Adversarial-Networks-GANs-Deep-Learning


Developed and trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic image data using convolutional architectures for both generator and discriminator. The project involved building a baseline GAN model, applying modifications such as architecture adjustments and hyperparameter tuning, and optimizing with Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Model performance was evaluated using the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric to assess the quality of generated images.
